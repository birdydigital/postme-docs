# Access and API keys

## Setup environment

First thing you need to do is creating a developer account.
* Go to [app.postme.io](https://app.postme.io)
* Click on "Create a developer account"
* Activate your email adress

### Register your application

* From the dashboard, go to "My apps"
* Click on "New App"
* Enter a title for your app (i.e. "My invoicing system")
* Save

### Generate a key

Once your application is created, you can generate App ID/key pairs to get API access.

* Click on "Generate New Key"
* Enter a name for the new generated key (i.e. "Test")
